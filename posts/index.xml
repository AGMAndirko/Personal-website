      <description>This year, the 8th European Society of Human Evolution meeting was held in Faro, (south Portugal). In a certain sense, holding a conference in the south of the iberian peninsula, home to the last Neanderthals, could be considered a felt homage to the diversity of the human family tree. The Calpe Museum in Gibraltar holds a parallel conference on Neanderthals, and not to far off, in Rabat, Morocco, the PanAf (PanAfrican Archaeological Association for Prehistory and Related Studies) was taking place.</description>

      <description>The University of Zurich has just created a Center for the Interdisciplinary Study of Language Evolution. Although there is already a Center for Language Evolution in Edinburgh, I have to say there aren&amp;rsquo;t so many around in Europe (although there is one center by our friends in Japan), so when we heard that there was going to be an inaugural event we immediately booked our tickets. For those who are not into Language Evolution, the center in Edinburgh is mostly focused in language complexity through iterated learning experiments, and the Evolinguistics group in Japan has a stronger biological focus, with special attention to birdsong research.</description>
