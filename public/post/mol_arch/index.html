<p>It used to be the hardest question to answer for me. The verbose answer is something like what I have in the <a href="https://andirko.eu">About me</a> section of my website:</p>




<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">
I study human cognition from a very interdisciplinary approach, including data from Genetics, Neurobiology, Comparative Cognition, Archaeology and early brain development. 
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad description, I guess. I wish I had something more specific, but my background and the kind of projects I have carried on so for have forced me this description. In any case, I don&rsquo;t feel there are many people doing the things I do, at least as I do them: most of the experts in human evolution (people far more competent than me) are either population geneticists, clinical researchers, field primatologists and archaeologists or hyperefficient bioinformaticians. I look up at each one of them and wish <strong>I were all at the same time</strong> (that might in fact be the problem!).</p>
<p>That means I lie in a sort of methodological limbo most of the time, specially as I am forced to use mostly &lsquo;second hand&rsquo; data such as every bit of aDNA that the Max Planck for Evolutionary Anthropology produces.</p>
<p>I think often about what my overall field is, and most of the times I use something like, well, <strong>Evolutionary Anthropology</strong>. The term captures:</p>
<ul>
<li>That I work in Evolution, but I don&rsquo;t do bones. I&rsquo;m opposing this to Biological Antropology, a term I like but can&rsquo;t use because it&rsquo;s traditionally associated with anatomy.</li>
<li>That I work with human biology, and that there is a remnant of the humanities in there. It should be a truism, but sadly it isn&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lets-readopt-molecular-archaeology">Let&rsquo;s readopt &lsquo;Molecular archaeology&rsquo;</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it this term was used before, but I think it was semi-popular in the first papers that establish the emergence of ancient DNA studies, such as <a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)81710-0/pdf">this one from 1989</a> by a certain future Max Planck director.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Molecular archaeology&rsquo; is a favourite for me. &lsquo;Evolutive Anthropology&rsquo; is a fine term, but as vage as it gets &ndash; it can encompass everything from genetics to purely archaeological work or primate ethology. I&rsquo;m ok with that, but let&rsquo;s consider the beauty of &lsquo;Molecular archaeology&rsquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>It assumes biological information as the primary method of study.</li>
<li>It incorporates archaeology, a better term than &ldquo;Anthropology&rdquo;, which is sometimes confused with the study of purely cultural practices. It&rsquo;s also pays a higher homage to the historical roots of the field, as a complement to the fossil record. Let&rsquo;s remember the first aDNA was recolected <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/314644a0">from an egiptian mummy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen &lsquo;molecular archaeology&rsquo; used as much lately. <strong>How about we reclaim it?</strong></p>
<h1 id="ps-but-does-any-of-this-really-matter">PS: But does any of this really matter?</h1>
<p>One could argue that these details don&rsquo;t matter as long as your job is good - but before you do so, consider how necessary quick and accurate labelling has become in communicating research. I wish I could just tell people what I do in extent, but the hypercompetition of science as it is built today do force us to adopt sometimes funny field descriptors. In any case, at least I appreciate it. It does force me as well to consider what constitutes a scientific discipline, and that&rsquo;s worth asking.</p>
