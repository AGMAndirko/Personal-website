    <h1 id="data-exploration-and-manipulation-tips">Data exploration and manipulation tips</h1>
<p>Programs like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> have been around for decades, and they sure survive the time test: some of these tools are <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">significantly faster</a> than some of the fancy new data science tools out there (as long as your data is not weirdly formated, at least). Unix tools are a wonder.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m asumming you know a bit about these unix tools. If you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry: there are a lot of tutorials out there that could help you. <a href="http://ptmartins.info/">Pedro Tiago Martins</a> and I wrote a course about terminal tools for total beginners. While we aren&rsquo;t exactly experts, if you have never touched a terminal I recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used programs like <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> more and more as my PhD progresses, but there&rsquo;s always room for improvement. <strong>Here are a couple methods I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with</strong> to make my data exploration and manipulation in the command line more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="ctrl-x--ctrl-e-command-editing"><code>Ctrl x + Ctrl e</code> command editing</h2>
<p>I used <code>Sublime Text</code> for a long time. While I still think it&rsquo;s a great program and sometimes still resort to it, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn some <code>VIM</code>, in part because I&rsquo;m a nerd, but also because there&rsquo;s inherent value to it in terms of time-saving when you master it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a useful tip a learned recently: if you type <code>Ctrl x + Ctrl e</code> while in the command line you can edit whatever command you are writting at the moment. That&rsquo;s a big deal sometimes when you have a typo in the middle of a very long pipeline in any editor, but with <code>VIM</code> &rsquo;s capacity to move around text in two keystrokes it becomes an impressive time saver.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-pipeline-command">Using the &lsquo;pipeline&rsquo; command</h2>
<p>If you are anything like me, you probable write your pipelines in your console only to find the latest error, and rewrite the pipeline until the desired output is printed. That&rsquo;s a lot of <code>enter</code> and going back.</p>
<p>I recently found out about <a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/pipeline">pipeline</a>, a util that prints a live, <code>less</code>-like output of your pipeline as you write. My only problem with this is that the approach is not compatible with the <code>cntl x + cntl e</code> approach to writing pipes I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of usage as shown in the command&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/pipeline">Github page</a>:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codekitchen/pipeline/master/pipeline_demo.gif" alt="example" title="example"></p>
<h2 id="custom-aliases-and-functions-for-basic-but-wordy-operations">Custom aliases and functions for basic (but wordy) operations</h2>
<p>This is <strong>not new at all</strong> if you are into the command line, but I recently started applying it more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Over the time I&rsquo;ve found myself writing the same basic operations many times. In some cases it&rsquo;s things like <code>sort file | uniq</code> (the common operation of sorting a file and printing only non-duplicated lines). This kind of cases are not a big deal to write. However, I like to use a lot of <code>awk</code>, specially in combination with things like <code>sed</code>. And <code>awk</code> can be extremely wordy.</p>
<p>Take a basic operation like printing the first column of a file:
<code>awk '{print $1}' file </code>
Those opening curly brackets and apostrophes are my bane &ndash; I used to find myself constantly forgetting any of those.Of course, this is a bit of a silly example, but you can make it as complex as you need (and <code>awk</code> <em>does</em> have a way to be more complicated).
However, it&rsquo;s often the case that I want to check a particular column to, for example, see how many elements are duplicated, and I used to run into this small nuisance often.</p>
<p>A solution I&rsquo;ve found is to create a custom function for cases like that stored in my <code>.local/bin/</code> folder as a script with a <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> shebang. Storing it there assures that you can call the function anywhere in the system. Another option, for the shorter commands or functions, is to keep it like an alias in your <code>.bashrc</code> file (for example, <code>alias killall='jobs -p | xargs kill'</code> to kill, well, all the running jobs.</p>
<p>So, for the previous case, a custom function for the <code>awk</code> single column problem is as simple as keeping there a file called <code>awkcol</code>, for example (from <code>awk+column</code>) that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
COLN<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$1
awk -v co<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$COLN<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;{print $co}&#39;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$2<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>See it here in action:</p>
<img src="gifs/awkcol.gif" width="680" height="453"/>
<p>Personally I do is the following: the terminal keeps a <code>history</code> of everything, so from time to time I check it to see if there&rsquo;s anything I could be making easier. Things I&rsquo;ve slowly integrated into my workflow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git add/commit/push workflows.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> fullgit<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
    git add .
    git status
    git commit -a -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$1<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
    git push
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Sed conversions from .csv to .tsv and viceversa: as simple as <code>sed 's/,/\t/g'</code> or <code>sed 's/\t/,/g'</code> but reduced to a much more comfortable <code>sed2t</code> or <code>sed2c</code>, for example.</li>
<li>The aforementioned <code>sort file | uniq</code> operation</li>
<li>Extracting files regardless of extension (thousands of examples in the web for this one &ndash; I use <a href="https://gist.github.com/idev247/823464">this one</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a caveat regarding reproducibility</strong>: Of course all these things are going to mess up with your code&rsquo;s reproducibility if you include these custom functions in something you want to publish.</p>
<p><strong>Extra note:</strong> I picked this tip up from the <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/1e/index.html">Data Science at the command line</a> book &ndash; I found it a really nice resource and it has inspired a good part of this post. Do check it out.</p>
<!---
There's a problem, for example, at which `awk` excels, that has accumulated tons of stack overflow questions because of the sometimes counterintuitive nature of awk scripting. Imagine you have `file1` and `file2`, and you want to see if a column it's shared  between the two, and then add a third column to the output, like this:


```sh
> less file1
a b c
123 524 0.9

> less file2
a b c 
tes tes test
```

<ul>
<li>The great looking <a href="https://github.com/Factual/drake">drake</a> tool, designed for multi-stepped processes where you have to, for example, download something heavy. <code>Drake</code> ensures you only have to do this once if you haven&rsquo;t changed any datapoint upstream. Discussed at lenght at the <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/1e/index.html">Data Science at the command line</a> book.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard great things of <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d use it as much, as I use <code>Konsole</code> and so far the tab functionality covers my needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://terminalsare.sexy/#terminals-are-sexy">Here&rsquo;s</a> a nice compilation of all things terminal. I&rsquo;m currently trying out the <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a> command listed there to minimize my <code>cd</code>&lsquo;ing around.</li>
