I’m a PhD student on Cognitive Science and Language, under the direction of Prof. Cedric Boeckx. I have a background in Linguistics, but my current focus is on the evolution of the Homo Sapiens cognitive profile. I study human cognition from an interdisciplinary approach, including data from Genetics, Neurobiology, Comparative Cognition, Archaeology and early brain and skull development to understand the 'human condition'. 

Other side interests include Bioinformatics, Philosophy of Biology and Philosophy of Science.
