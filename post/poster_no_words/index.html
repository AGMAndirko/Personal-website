    <h1 id="i-presented-a-poster-with-no-text---heres-my-experience">I presented a poster with no text - here&rsquo;s my experience</h1>
<p>At some point when I was learning the ropes of academic life I read on Twitter that scientific posters should have as little text as possible.</p>
<p>For some context, I don&rsquo;t really like posters, overall. I tend to see them as a lot of one-use-only sunk cost. I appreciate the format, but it takes a ridiculous ammount of preparation, compared, to, for example, a talk. I feel, for example, that the graphic aspect of a poster might play more interest in attracting people than the ideas &ndash; the quality of the work behind plays a role on the people that approach you, of course, but in general most people quickly dismiss a poorly designed poster, meaning time doing <strong>graphic design</strong> that doesn&rsquo;t fall within your normal responsabilities as a researcher. This places an unnecessary burden in early career researchers in already very competitive environments (plus, <strong>the price</strong> of those things! for one use! you are lucky if your university covers it).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s another story. Despite my complaints, early in my PhD I spent a lot of time thinking about posters and how to make them efficient. As I see it, the work of a poster is to foster conversation, and I thought, back in 2018, that the less text there is the more time you can spend discussing. I also dislike the idea of just smiling politely while people read your poster - I prefer a short explanation followed by a meaningful chat.</p>
<p>So an idea occured to me. <strong>What would happen if I present a poster with no text?</strong> Would I get a more interactive experience? Would people focus less on the material support and more on talking about the ideas and work behind?</p>
<h1 id="expectations">Expectations</h1>
<p>There were a number of things I expected from a wordless poster before the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall <strong>less time writting</strong> a sucint version of my work, of course, and more time thinking about what to highlight and which questions are important.</li>
<li>A forced <strong>&ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; training</strong> as a consequence of having to present your idea in a couple sentences. I prepared a short (~1 minute) version and a longer, more detailed description, and planned on asking people which one did they prefer.</li>
<li>Less people looking at the poster, and overall getting into <strong>more natural interactions</strong> with scientists that approached.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-happened">What happened</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>You spend the same time</strong> working on the poster regardless. In fact, an all-figure poster brings a host of different problems with placing, the pace of figures, and clarity. You have to have a lot of nice figures to present as well, potentially including some <em>ad hoc</em> ones - I spent a lot of time in a tree of human evolution, for example, to accompany a point that could have been covered by a paragraph.</li>
<li>Most people approached, looked at the poster confusingly and then asked some sort of &ldquo;what is this about&rdquo; question. I explained that was a concious decission and went into a short &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo;. After asking if they wanted more details, a conversation followed - sometimes, as in regular posters. <strong>I didn&rsquo;t get more or less engagment than usual</strong>, unlike what I expected, or more quality conversation than with regular posters: I did get some nice compliments about the idea and the overall design, but having no text didn&rsquo;t help chanelling the conversation around particular features, for example. Some conversations were insightful, but I didn&rsquo;t feel the poster played any role in that regard.</li>
<li><strong>A wordless poster also projects the idea that you have nothing to show</strong> - something that I don&rsquo;t think is always fair, though in this particular case it wasn&rsquo;t too far off. The feedback I received in that conference helped me drop a project that was conceptually nebulous, so my experience might have more to do with the content and experimental framework than with the poster. The conversations that led to that conclussion <strong>did flow more naturally</strong> compared to a regular poster, maybe because the &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; approach is more efficient than reading the whole poster and then ask questions.</li>
<li>I did notice that most people paid a great deal of attention to the figures, as is natural, but that they were often misrepresented when people wanted to know the details too early - <strong>captions and text help interpretation</strong> more than I assumed. A better figure design might have helped.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="some-lessons">Some lessons</h1>
<p>The text in you poster is cumbersome to design and write, fatiguing to read when you have dozens of posters in a hall and will make you stand awkwardly for a wile. But it also helps <strong>grounding</strong> the kind of conversations you keep and prevent misinterpretation. The quality of the poster plays a role, but it&rsquo;s easier to design a good poster with text, overall. <strong>Also, I&rsquo;m sorry to say this poster was equally awkward without text &ndash; there is no going around that.</strong></p>
<h1 id="conclusion-i-cant-really-recommend">Conclusion: I can&rsquo;t really recommend</h1>
<p>&hellip; Unless you are a graphics designer, your figures are amazing and crystal clear or people already know what you are going to present in a poster. It was a fun experience, overall, but I think it&rsquo;s not worth it. Let me know if your experience is different.</p>
<p><strong>I do recommend, nevertheless, hybrid formats, such as posting QRs</strong> in you poster leading to a digital copy of it, or to a paper and bibliography. That poster was the first time I did it, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve kept doing for subsequent posters. Overall, people like to be able to read a poster later, or retrieve a particular data point or reference from it - it saves you time and space in the poster.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still don&rsquo;t like presenting posters.</p>
