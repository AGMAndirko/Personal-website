    <h1 id="academic-time">Academic time</h1>
<p>I was surfing Twitter when I came across  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16574" target="_blank">this preprint</a> about how often do academics in different career points miss deadlines. I was not very surprised by the main conclusion (we all underestimate deadlines). but I found specially interesting a figure in particular. Here&rsquo;s the pie chart that shows time spent in each task per academic position:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="pics/pie_time.png" width="680" height="453" style="vertical-align:middle">
</figure>
<p>(Note that this is self-reported data, so it might be the case that people under or overestimate time spend doing something specific relative to skill proficiency. In any case, I&rsquo;m sure my own time is roughly divided as it corresponds to the data.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know from which discipline did they extract their data, but notice how almost 50% of grad student time corresponds to coding. I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the percentage of time writing code is way smaller in PIs, as seen by the tendency to smaller times in postdocs and counting with increasing administrative duties. That would mean most of the code we are generating in accademia is done by people who normally just started learning or are at intermediate stages. I imagine there is a factor of efficiency going on here (a postdoc might spend much less time writing code than an undergrad due to experience), but still, it&rsquo;s striking.</p>
<p>And there is maybe a problem with this. The people with higher conceptual and technical skills should be the ones doing the most coding, ideally. I think it&rsquo;s uncontroversial to claim that code by PIs and postdocs is more likely to generate data that ends up in a published paper than that of grad and undergrad student. I&rsquo;m not claiming the code by undergrads and grad students is inherently worse, but less experience necessarily comes with more common technical pitfalls, for example. Ironically, that&rsquo;s at odds with the current laboral structure of academia, where there are more PhD students than postdocs or, of course, PIs. I&rsquo;m assuming here that most of the work undergrads spend coding includes learning to code, and that most of that is assignment-oriented rather than directed to publishing.</p>
<p>This reinforces an idea that I&rsquo;ve had for a while: that pair coding should be the standard practice in labs, as it reduces the possibility that errors happen in early stages of the academic career, plus it acts as a chain of transmission of technical knowledge in a lab and solves most of the time spent having doubts about code. Of course, that&rsquo;s without adressing structural issues with science as a job market, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
