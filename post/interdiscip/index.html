    <h1 id="some-thoughts-on-from-a-field-hopper">Some thoughts on from a field hopper</h1>
<p>If someone had told me that I would be doing what I do now five years ago, I would have laughed at their face.</p>
<p>In 2016 I had just graduated from a BA in language and literature. Considering now I work on something closer to Genetics, regardless of the results, is already something. Strangely enough, this journey hasn&rsquo;t felt anything else than smooth in terms of the logic of the steps. On top of that, I landed on a highly interdisciplinary  <a href="http://cbl.ub.edu/index.php/media/" target="_blank">research group</a>, so believe me when I say I know what interdisciplinariety feels like.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I want to propose to you an exercise: try to come up with one scientific discipline that exists in total isolation of others.</p>
<p>I do this often to remind myself that multidisciplinary work is the law, not the exception. Everytime I try to think about one, I fail. The epistemic landscape of modern science is a woven fabric of threads that cross each other. In practice, no discipline exists in a total vacuum, and even highly specific research objects are informed by other disciplines either in terms of methodology or the different levels of complexity that inform that object.</p>
<p>In that sense, it&rsquo;s more common to do interdisciplinary research than not. Interdisciplinarity is unavoidable, because our reality don&rsquo;t always align with the neatly defined categories that are departments or scientific disciplines. I sometimes think that entire disciplines aren&rsquo;t but the success of selling an interdisciplinary enterprise in a neatly presented package &ndash; for an extreme case, take any species-specific discipline in Biology, such as Primatology. Primatology is, effectively, only held together by its subject of study, despite a wide range of methodologies, focuses and relationships with other disciplines (Ecology, Ethology, Genetics&hellip;).</p>
<p>On top of that, interdisciplinariety gets a kind of buzz that is often the perfect claim for the academic market (be it in journals or funding agencies).</p>
<p>So, if interdisciplinariety is everywhere and avoiding it is practically impossible, why does it feel like nowhere&rsquo;s land? How can it, at the same time, be fundamental to science and a rare instance of scientific altruism regardless of departamental boundaries? This is the paradox of multidisciplinariety.</p>
<h1 id="the-traditional-interdisciplinary-research">The traditional interdisciplinary research</h1>
<p>The most common approach to interdisciplinary Various groups from different backgrounds collaborate in one (or several) projects. This is in fact a logical progression for science: two groups of different backgrounds join forces to solve a scientific problem that would be otherwise imposible to solve individually. As the saying says, &lsquo;complex problems require complex solutions&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fact that this it&rsquo;s the most seen way to carry out interdisciplinary research doesn&rsquo;t mean is easy. Establishing a common body of work, an efficient communication and clear pipelines and procedures that work for everyone involved is a grueling job and implies a work of trust over years. It&rsquo;s also assumed that collaborations aren&rsquo;t the only means of living for a given group, and that they will continue to publish on their more traditional lines.</p>
<p>This model is ok, but, as you can imagine, it has various problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of conferences</li>
<li>Journals are high</li>
<li>trust needed</li>
<li>No formation</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="interdisciplinariety-is-problematic">Interdisciplinariety is problematic</h1>
<p>But see, that is the problem. Science is, generally, interdisciplinary, yet the structure of science as it is conceived now is not. Effectively, we still organize our departments according to insular units that live in the</p>
<p>We organize grants on general topics, such as &lsquo;Biology&rsquo;. In general, these are not terrible classifications - the proof is that there is such a thing as biological sciences, and thosse can apply to those specific grants. But there are specific kinds of research that can result in a liminal state - too much for one discipline, too little for another.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a PhD candidate in Primatology, to follow up with the previous example. You work in, say,
You&rsquo;d be facing various problems. First, grants and institutions. If you manage to secure a grant, you might land, if you are lucky, with a PI that does the same work you are interested in. However, grants are not abundant, as most PhD students know too well, and sometimes awkward fits are made to secure a position. I&rsquo;ve know people working with supervisors that don&rsquo;t work in their fields. This is now inherently bad, though it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Second, journals. Effectively, the emergence of specific niche journals is useful to organize knowledge, but also most journals of this kind are a consequence of the efforts of</p>
<p>Third, workload. You&rsquo;d be pressed to know a bit of everything. That is usually the case with any PhD, but is reinforced by the structures of training in departments.</p>
<p>In effect, any time you fall in between scientific boundaries</p>
<p>Of course, there is a positive side to this: &lsquo;interdisciplinarity&rsquo; sells very well.</p>
<h1 id="the-risks-of-interdisciplinariety">The risks of interdisciplinariety</h1>
<p>But interdisciplinariety also holds its own risks. The more blurry the boundaries between scientific disciplines in your research, the harder it is for you to focus on being methodologically sound.</p>
