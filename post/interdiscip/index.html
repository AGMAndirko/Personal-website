    <h1 id="interdisciplinariety-is-unavoidable">Interdisciplinariety is unavoidable</h1>
<p>I want to propose to you an exercise: try to come up with one scientific discipline that exists in total isolation of others.</p>
<p>Of course, there is none. One can only consider the epistemic landscape of modern science as a woven fabric of threads that cross each other. In practice, no discipline exists in a total vacuum, and even highly specific research objects are informed by other disciplines either in terms of methodology or the different levels of complexity that inform that object. This should be a self-evident reality. Even in mathematics, arguably the potentially more insular discipline possible, any given subfield is necessarily informed by levels of theoretical complexity that support the tools of mathematical exploration; a theory of numbers depends on a cultural understanding of numbers, for example.</p>
<p>In that sense, it&rsquo;s more common to do interdisciplinary research than not. Interdisciplinarity is unavoidable, because our reality don&rsquo;t always align with the neatly defined categories that are departments or scientific disciplines. I sometimes think that entire disciplines aren&rsquo;t but the success of selling an interdisciplinary enterprise in a neatly presented package &ndash; for an extreme case, take any species-specific discipline in Biology, such as Primatology. Primatology is, effectively, only held together by its subject of study, despite a wide range of methodologies, focuses and relationships with other disciplines (Ecology, Ethology, Genetics&hellip;).</p>
<h1 id="the-traditional-interdisciplinary-research">The traditional interdisciplinary research</h1>
<p>Various groups from different backgrounds collaborate in one (or several) projects.
It&rsquo;s efficient, but</p>
<h1 id="interdisciplinariety-is-problematic">Interdisciplinariety is problematic</h1>
<p>But see, that is the problem. Science is, generally, interdisciplinary, yet the structure of science as it is conceived now is not. Effectively, we still organize our departments according to insular units that live in the</p>
<p>We organize grants on general topics, such as &lsquo;Biology&rsquo;. In general, these are not terrible classifications - the proof is that there is such a thing as biological sciences, and thosse can apply to those specific grants. But there are specific kinds of research that can result in a liminal state - too much for one discipline, too little for another.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a PhD candidate in Primatology, to follow up with the previous example. You work in, say,
You&rsquo;d be facing various problems. First, grants and institutions. If you manage to secure a grant, you might land, if you are lucky, with a PI that does the same work you are interested in. However, grants are not abundant, as most PhD students know too well, and sometimes awkward fits are made to secure a position. I&rsquo;ve know people working with supervisors that don&rsquo;t work in their fields. This is now inherently bad, though it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Second, journals. Effectively, the emergence of specific niche journals is useful to organize knowledge, but also most journals of this kind are a consequence of the efforts of</p>
<p>Third, workload. You&rsquo;d be pressed to know a bit of everything. That is usually the case with any PhD, but is reinforced by the structures of training in departments.</p>
<p>In effect, any time you fall in between scientific boundaries</p>
<p>Of course, there is a positive side to this: &lsquo;interdisciplinarity&rsquo; sells very well.</p>
<h1 id="the-risks-of-interdisciplinariety">The risks of interdisciplinariety</h1>
<p>But interdisciplinariety also holds its own risks. The more blurry the boundaries between scientific disciplines in your research, the harder it is for you to focus on being methodologically sound.</p>
