By intersecting our experimental data with new paleogenetic analyses comparing modern and archaic humans, we found a modern-specific enrichment for regulatory changes both in BAZ1B and its experimentally defined downstream targets, thereby providing the first empirical validation of the human self-domestication hypothesis and positioning BAZ1B as a master regulator of the modern human face. In so doing, we provide experimental evidence that the craniofacial and cognitive/behavioral phenotypes caused by alterations of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region can serve as a powerful entry point into the evolution of the modern human face and prosociality.\n","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"caf1f57ce671dd0b3b840c7ca0ebc156","permalink":"/publications/baz1b/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publications/baz1b/","section":"publications","summary":"BAZ1B regulates neural crest migration.

At the same time, we have seen the emergence of big databases of modern human genetic variation. However, linking human genetic variation, neuronal phenotypes and, eventually, behaviour, is only possible if we understand how variation and genetic regulation interact. We used two publicly available datasets, the GTEX cis-eQTL database (v7) and a catalog of high-frequency Homo sapiens specific alleles relative to the Neanderthals and Denisovan sequences, to understand how high-frequency Homo Sapiens derived alleles affect gene expression regulation. The resulting dataset shows that genes associated with brain development are affected by Homo sapiens-specific eQTL in brain areas key in human evolution such as the cerebellum. We also show that some of these eQTL overlap significantly with putative regions of positive selection relative to archaic humans (Peyregne et al., 2017). Additionally, we tested whether any of the variants are associated with clinical conditions in modern human populations. These findings can inform future experimental work and enrich current venues of research of the Homo Sapiens brain evolution, such as the relationship between clinical and evolutionary research and the recent expansion of the cerebellum in Homo Sapiens (Gunz et al., 2010).","tags":["eQTL","Genetics","Brain"],"title":"Derived Homo sapiens cis-eQTL regulation: implications for brain evolution","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Constantina Theofanopoulou","Alejandro Andirko"," Cedric Boeckx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"5ac035674fa9e1d33615a4721114c12d","permalink":"/publications/oxt/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publications/oxt/","section":"publications","summary":"Modern humans lifestyle strongly depends on complex social skills like empathy, tolerance and cooperation. Variation in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and the arginine-vasopressin receptors (AVPR1A, AVPR1B genes) has been widely associated with diverse facets of social cognition, but the extent to which these variants may have contributed to the evolution of human prosociality remains to be elucidated. In this study, we compared the OXTR, AVPR1A and AVPR1B DNA sequences of modern humans to those of our closest extinct and extant relatives, and then clustered the variants we identified based on their distribution in the species studied. This clustering, along with the functional importance retrieved for each variant and their frequency in different modern-human populations, is then used to determine if any of the OXTR, AVPR1A and AVPR1B-variants might have had an impact at different evolutionary stages. We report a total of 29 SNPs, associated with phenotypic effects ranging from clearly pro-social to mixed or antisocial. Regarding modern human-specific alleles that could correlate with a shift towards prosociality in modern-humans, we highlight one allele in AVPR1A (rs11174811), found at high frequency and linked to prosocial phenotypes in modern humans, while the ancestral allele is associated with antisocial phenotypes. We also report three sites of putatively convergent changes between modern humans and bonobos (rs237897(A), rs2228485(G) and rs1042615(A)), and note the absence of such a convergent pattern between modern humans and chimpanzees. Finally, we observe the high concentration of modern human specific alleles in vasopressin receptors not paralleled in the oxytocin receptor.","tags":["Social cognition","Genetics"],"title":"Oxytocin and Vasopressin Receptor variants as a window onto the evolution of human prosociality","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Saleh Alamri","Alejandro Andirkó","Thomas O’Rourke","Pedro Tiago Martins","Cedric Boeckx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521068400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521068400,"objectID":"01b0d6d0953ac9377209cd99e1bf8fd6","permalink":"/talk/evolang18/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/evolang18/","section":"talk","summary":"'Symbolic behavior' is not a term researchers use informatively","tags":["Archaeology","Interdisciplinary"],"title":"The 'guns, germs \u0026 steel' underlying Homo Sapiens unique material culture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alejandro Andirkó"],"categories":null,"content":"EMBL, one of the biggest biology research institutions in the world, has organized a symposium in paleogenomics, and of course the lineup is more than impressive: Svante Pääbo, David Reich, Beth Saphiro and countless of amazing experts were gathering in the impressive, DNA-themed EMBL building in Heidelberg. Sadly, part of the conference overlapped with the American Association of Physical Anthropologist meeting, the biggest gathering of experts having to do with Human Evolution [^1]. Still, the event managed to address a very wide range of topics, from Neanderthal genetics to pioneer methodologies in aDNA, but also leaving room to recent history studies, pathogens and domestication research.\nMe and the rest of the Cognitive Biology of Language group arrived to Heidelberg the day before. We knew the EMBL building was not in the city but somewhere in the hills around, but we had no clue about where to pick the buses of at what time. Luckily for us, EBML had set up an app to work you through the city, including the full schedule of the conference, a list of attendants and speakers and other utilities. The app managed to be very useful during the next days, not only because I always struggle to keep the paper with the program close to me but because the bus schedule was in your hand at all times. Kudos for that!\nThe conference started with a keynote by Svante Pääbo, who gave an overview of his work in the field of paleogenomics (which is, on a large extent, also the history of the field itself). I had the luck of watching other talks by Pääbo before, and I knew already that the exciting content always arrives by the end, with the promise of functionally testing the neanderthal versions of several brain-related genes in brain organoids. The buzz around neanderthalized brain organoids has been going on for a while since an article in the Science magazine news section claimed that the group led by A. Muotri is working on it; whenever it\u0026rsquo;s done is going to be a landmark for the understanding of Neanderthal cognition, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure Pääbo, who is not so far away from retirement, would love to put a final ribbon to his already highly influential career.\nAnother of the ways people are trying to figure out phenotypical effects of the Neanderthal genome is through introgressed sections in modern human populations. Joshua Akey\u0026rsquo;s talk, for example, addressed how they used the UK Biobank to link these alleles to phenotypes, finding interesting things such as a higher risk of depression, among other things [^2]. A new high-coverage Neanderthal genome from Chagyrskaya in preparation for publication might shed new light into potential windows for functional testing [^3]\nOn the technical side, there was also talk about much expected retrieval of aDNA from sediments, and other technical advances such as new statistical measures that eliminate the need for reference sequences, that can introduce biases into the mapping of DNA readings. Other talks addressed the need, nevertheless, of introducing more diverse african reference sequences to account for the continent\u0026rsquo;s diversity. In fact, Mattias Jakobson\u0026rsquo;s group is trying hard to get recent history aDNA sequences from Africa to account for migration dynamics inside the continent that could affect the kind of simulations that tell us about the emergence of Homo Sapiens - including the date of emergence [^4].

In a certain sense, holding a conference in the south of the iberian peninsula, home to the last Neanderthals, could be considered a felt homage to the diversity of the human family tree. The Calpe Museum in Gibraltar holds a parallel conference on Neanderthals, and not to far off, in Rabat, Morocco, the PanAf (PanAfrican Archaeological Association for Prehistory and Related Studies) was taking place. Three major scientific events related to human evolution almost at the same time, to the delight of those following on Twitter - and the chagrin of the ESHE organization.\nThe fact that there were around 400 attendants allowed to have an overall impression to the field, from lithics to bones and genetics. As a very interdisciplinary cognitive scientist, I was very much satisfied with the diversity of fields represented, all of them offering insights into our history - as we need as much information as we can gather. Underlying most talks was the idea that we can\u0026rsquo;t no longer think about a \u0026lsquo;craddle of humanity\u0026rsquo;, but several, and that this diversity is key to understand our deep evolutionary history. The fossil record shows an incredible range of archaic and modern looking fossils in overlapping time frames, distributed spatially all over the African continent, yet most archaeological research is done at the same old places, like the Afar basin, in Ethiopia. Broadening our horizons means digging in different sites, as the opening lecture by René Bobe emphasized - and the field is taking good note.\nIt also means understanding better what we have until now. The recent (polemic) redating of some caves in Spain has given back Neanderthals authorship over their art, but also work on classic sites like Skuhl, Turkana or Sima de los Huesos might still offer us new insights on the Homo history. In addition, new methods for old bones are gaining track: a personal highlight is the promising work on proteomics, which might help us identify bones in a non-destructive way (unlike the not so preservation-friendly aDNA recollection). Geometric morphometrics, a more than familiar method for most archaeologists, is being constantly improved, and we had our fair share in the talks and posters, from . I really think some day near morphometric variation will meet genetics, not so far down the road.\nOn the aDNA note: there has been much buzz in the field about Denny, the famous Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid found recently by the team led by Viviane Slon and Svante Pääbo, and it was exciting to hear a bit more about this very lucky finding (you can read a great post by Viviane just here.\nExpect exciting findings like this in future conference reports!\n","date":1461103200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515798000,"objectID":"3d675f85f61ee4db8fea45f6faa397e8","permalink":"/posts/eshe18/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/posts/eshe18/","section":"posts","summary":"First time in an ESHE meeting!
