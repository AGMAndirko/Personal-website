Variation in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and the arginine-vasopressin receptors (AVPR1A, AVPR1B genes) has been widely associated with diverse facets of social cognition, but the extent to which these variants may have contributed to the evolution of human prosociality remains to be elucidated. In this study, we compared the OXTR, AVPR1A and AVPR1B DNA sequences of modern humans to those of our closest extinct and extant relatives, and then clustered the variants we identified based on their distribution in the species studied. This clustering, along with the functional importance retrieved for each variant and their frequency in different modern-human populations, is then used to determine if any of the OXTR, AVPR1A and AVPR1B-variants might have had an impact at different evolutionary stages. We report a total of 29 SNPs, associated with phenotypic effects ranging from clearly pro-social to mixed or antisocial. Regarding modern human-specific alleles that could correlate with a shift towards prosociality in modern-humans, we highlight one allele in AVPR1A (rs11174811), found at high frequency and linked to prosocial phenotypes in modern humans, while the ancestral allele is associated with antisocial phenotypes. We also report three sites of putatively convergent changes between modern humans and bonobos (rs237897(A), rs2228485(G) and rs1042615(A)), and note the absence of such a convergent pattern between modern humans and chimpanzees. Finally, we observe the high concentration of modern human specific alleles in vasopressin receptors not paralleled in the oxytocin receptor.","tags":["Social cognition","Genetics"],"title":"Oxytocin and Vasopressin Receptor variants as a window onto the evolution of human prosociality","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Saleh Alamri","Alejandro Andirkó","Thomas O’Rourke","Pedro Tiago Martins","Cedric Boeckx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521068400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521068400,"objectID":"01b0d6d0953ac9377209cd99e1bf8fd6","permalink":"/talk/evolang18/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/evolang18/","section":"talk","summary":"'Symbolic behavior' is not a term researchers use informatively","tags":["Archaeology","Interdisciplinary"],"title":"The 'guns, arms \u0026 steel' underlying Homo Sapiens unique material culture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alejandro M.

In a certain sense, holding a conference in the south of the iberian peninsula, home to the last Neanderthals, could be considered a felt homage to the diversity of the human family tree. The Calpe Museum in Gibraltar holds a parallel conference on Neanderthals, and not to far off, in Rabat, Morocco, the PanAf (PanAfrican Archaeological Association for Prehistory and Related Studies) was taking place. Three major scientific events related to human evolution almost at the same time, to the delight of those following on Twitter - and the chagrin of the ESHE organization.\nThe fact that there were around 400 attendants allowed to have an overall impression to the field, from lithics to bones and genetics. As a very interdisciplinary cognitive scientist, I was very much satisfied with the diversity of fields represented, all of them offering insights into our history - as we need as much information as we can gather. Underlying most talks was the idea that we can\u0026rsquo;t no longer think about a \u0026lsquo;craddle of humanity\u0026rsquo;, but several, and that this diversity is key to understand our deep evolutionary history. The fossil record shows an incredible range of archaic and modern looking fossils in overlapping time frames, distributed spatially all over the African continent, yet most archaeological research is done at the same old places, like the Afar basin, in Ethiopia. Broadening our horizons means digging in different sites, as the opening lecture by René Bobe emphasized - and the field is taking good note.\nIt also means understanding better what we have until now. The recent (polemic) redating of some caves in Spain has given back Neanderthals authorship over their art, but also work on classic sites like Skuhl, Turkana or Sima de los Huesos might still offer us new insights on the Homo history. In addition, new methods for old bones are gaining track: a personal highlight is the promising work on proteomics, which might help us identify bones in a non-destructive way (unlike the not so preservation-friendly aDNA recollection). Geometric morphometrics, a more than familiar method for most archaeologists, is being constantly improved, and we had our fair share in the talks and posters, from . I really think some day near morphometric variation will meet genetics, not so far down the road.\nOn the aDNA note: there has been much buzz in the field about Denny, the famous Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid found recently by the team led by Viviane Slon and Svante Pääbo, and it was exciting to hear a bit more about this very lucky finding (you can read a great post by Viviane just here.\nExpect exciting findings like this in future conference reports!\n","date":1461103200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515798000,"objectID":"9d438cf26b2bc58bb59d8c4c23466230","permalink":"/post/eshe18/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/eshe18/","section":"post","summary":"First time in an ESHE meeting!
