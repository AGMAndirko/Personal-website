	abstract = {Symmetrical 7q11.23 dosage alterations cause craniofacial and cognitive/behavioral phenotypes that provide a privileged entry point into the evolution of the modern human face and (pro-) sociality. We undertook a functional dissection of chromatin remodeler BAZ1B in neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) from a uniquely informative cohort of typical and atypical patients harboring 7q11.23 Copy Number Variants (CNVs). Our results reveal a key contribution of BAZ1B to NCSC in vitro induction and migration, coupled with a crucial involvement in neural crest (NC)-specific transcriptional circuits and distal regulation. By intersecting our experimental data with new paleogenetic analyses comparing modern and archaic humans, we uncover a modern-specific enrichment for regulatory changes both in BAZ1B and its experimentally defined downstream targets, thereby providing the first empirical validation of the self-domestication hypothesis and positioning BAZ1B as a master regulator of the modern human face.},
