<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Welcome to my <strong>personal webpage</strong>. This is the space where I <a href="/posts/">rant</a>, <a href="/wiki/">accumulate notes on various topics that interest me</a> and <a href="/log/">log the things I do</a>. I also host a couple <a href="/cv/">CVs</a>, in case you came here for that. In general, this place is where I regain a sense of personal joy from the collection of walled gardens that is becoming internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently a <strong>developer</strong> at <a href="https://www.teralco.com/en/">Teralco</a>, a middle-sized tech consultancy company in Elche, (Alicante, Spain). I work mostly with <strong>Python</strong>, but enjoy and have worked with <strong>R</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>command-line utilities/Bash</strong>. I did a bit of <strong>Scala</strong> at some point, but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>Before that, in 2021, I got a <strong>PhD</strong> degree in Cognitive Science and Language. I did research as part of the <a href="http://cbl.ub.edu/">Cognitive Biology of Language</a> group, led by Cedric Boeckx (University of Barcelona). I was trained as a linguist, but always had a strong interest in Biology and Cognitive Science. During my PhD I focused on the evolution of the Homo sapiens cognitive profile relative to other human species (Neanderthals, Denisovans), from genotype to expression data to phenotype.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m no longer in academia, this website has grown into a more personal space, rather than the CV and project showcase it was before.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>Apart from the professional stuff, in my free time I like to <strong>play bass</strong> - mostly learning jazz vocabulary now. I try to expose myself to different music every day, with uneven sucess. You see how that is going <a href="/log/listening/">here</a>.</p>
<p>At other levels, I enjoy: running, wikipedia rabbit holes, mate, dogs, raw liquorice, sci-fi, ecology and philosophy, rpgs (virtual and pen-and-paper like), plants. I&rsquo;m also slowly becoming more active on <a href="https://www.extinctionrebellion.es/">the fight against climate change inaction</a> and learning lots on the way.</p>
<h2 id="blogposts">Blogposts</h2>
<p>From time to time I like to write <a href="/posts/">posts about my former research field, technical tips and courses</a>. I don&rsquo;t add many these days, rather prefering to expand my <a href="/wiki/">personal wiki</a> instead, but from time to time more fully formed posts still end up there.</p>
<h2 id="log">Log</h2>
<p>I <a href="/log/">log</a> several of my activities as a form of self-accountability. Here&rsquo;s <a href="/post/log/">why</a>.</p>
<h2 id="academic-output">Academic output</h2>
<p>The original intent of this webpage was to display my CV and academic acomplishments. If you came for that, see my <a href="cv.pdf">academic CV</a>.</p>
